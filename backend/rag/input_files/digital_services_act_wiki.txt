Current legislation

The *Digital Services Act*^[1] <#cite_note-:2-1> (*DSA*) is an EU
regulation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_regulation> adopted in 2022
that addresses illegal content, transparent advertising and
disinformation. It updates the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Commerce_Directive_2000> in EU
law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_law>,^[2] <#cite_note-
euractive20200808-2> ^[3] <#cite_note-ft20201028-3> and was proposed
alongside the Digital Markets Act <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Digital_Markets_Act> (DMA).

The DSA applies to online platforms and intermediaries such as social
networks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network>, marketplaces
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace>, pornographic platforms
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_pornography>,^[4] <#cite_note-4>
and app stores <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_store>.^[5]
<#cite_note-:3-5> Key requirements include disclosing to regulators how
their algorithms work, providing users with explanations for content
moderation decisions, and implementing stricter controls on targeted
advertising. It also imposes specific rules on "very large" online
platforms and search engines (those having more than 45 million monthly
active users in the EU).^[6] <#cite_note-6>


Objectives

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Digital_Services_Act&action=edit&section=1>]

Ursula von der Leyen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ursula_von_der_Leyen> proposed a "new Digital Services Act" in her 2019
bid for the European Commission's presidency.^[7] <#cite_note-7>

The expressed purpose of the DSA was to update the European Union's
legal framework for illegal content on intermediaries, in particular by
modernising the e-Commerce Directive <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Electronic_Commerce_Directive_2000> that had been adopted in 2000. In
doing so, the DSA aimed to harmonise different national laws in the
European Union that have emerged to address illegal content at national
level.^[2] <#cite_note-euractive20200808-2> Most prominent amongst these
laws was the German NetzDG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Network_Enforcement_Act>, and similar laws in Austria
("Kommunikationsplattformen-Gesetz") and France ("Loi Avia <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_Avia>"). With the adoption of the Digital
Services Act at European level, those national laws were planned to be
overridden and would have to be amended.^[8] <#cite_note-8>

In practice, this would lead to new legislation regarding illegal
content, transparent advertising and disinformation.^[3] <#cite_note-
ft20201028-3> ^[/needs update <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items>/]


New obligations on platform companies

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Digital_Services_Act&action=edit&section=2>]

The DSA is meant to "govern the content moderation practices of social
media platforms" and address illegal content.^[9] <#cite_note-EDRi-9> It
is organised in five chapters, with the most important chapters
regulating the liability exemption of intermediaries (Chapter 2), the
obligations on intermediaries (Chapter 3), and the cooperation and
enforcement framework between the commission and national authorities
(Chapter 4).

The DSA proposal maintains the current rule according to which companies
that host others' data become liable when informed that this data is
illegal.^[9] <#cite_note-EDRi-9> This so-called "conditional liability
exemption" is fundamentally different^[10] <#cite_note-10> ^[11]
<#cite_note-11> from the broad immunities given to intermediaries under
the equivalent rule ("Section 230 CDA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Section_230>") in the United States.

The DSA applies to intermediary service providers that offer their
services to users based in the European Union, irrespective of whether
the intermediary service provider is established in the European
Union.^[12] <#cite_note-12>

In addition to the liability exemptions, the DSA would introduce a wide-
ranging set of new obligations on platforms, including some that aim to
disclose to regulators how their algorithms work, while other
obligations would create transparency on how decisions to remove content
are taken and on the way advertisers target users. The European Centre
for Algorithmic Transparency <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
European_Centre_for_Algorithmic_Transparency> was created to aid the
enforcement of this.^[13] <#cite_note-13>

A December 2020 /Time <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)>/
article said that while many of its provisions only apply to platforms
which have more than 45 million users in the European Union <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union>, the Act could have repercussions
beyond Europe. Platforms including Facebook <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Facebook>, Twitter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter>, TikTok
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok>, and Google's subsidiary YouTube
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube> would meet that threshold and be
subjected to the new obligations.^[14] <#cite_note-Perrigo_20201215-14>

A 16 November 2021 /Internet Policy Review/ listed some of new
obligations including mandatory "notice-and-action" requirements, for
example, respect fundamental rights, mandatory redress for content
removal decisions, and a comprehensive risk management and audit
framework.^[15] <#cite_note-15>

Companies that do not comply with the new obligations risk fines of up
to 6% on their global annual turnover. In addition, the Commission can
apply periodic penalties up to 5% of the average daily worldwide
turnover for each day of delay in complying with remedies, interim
measures, and commitments. As a last resort measure, if the infringement
persists and causes serious harm to users and entails criminal offences
involving threat to persons' life or safety, the Commission can request
the temporary suspension of the service.^[16] <#cite_note-digital-
strategy.ec.europa.eu-16>


Large online platforms

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Digital_Services_Act&action=edit&section=3>]

On 23 April 2023, the European Commission named a first list of 19
online platforms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Online_marketing_platform> that will be required to comply starting 25
August 2023.^[17] <#cite_note-17> They include the following very large
online platforms (VLOPs) with more than 45 million monthly active users
in the EU as of 17 February 2023.^[18] <#cite_note-18>

  * Alibaba AliExpress <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AliExpress>
  * Amazon Store <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)#Website>
  * Apple AppStore <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)>

  * Zalando <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalando>

Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs):

  * Bing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing>
  * Google Search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search>

Amazon and Zalando both initiated proceedings in the General Court
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Court_(European_Union)>
challenging the designations, claiming unequal treatment compared to
other large retailers, and that their core business models are retail
not distributing third party content/products. Zalando argued the
criteria and methodology lack transparency, for instance in how it
counts active users, while Amazon said VLOP rules are disproportionate
for its business model and asked to be exempted from transparency around
targeted ads.^[19] <#cite_note-19> ^[20] <#cite_note-20>

As of December 2023, 13 VLOPs have received a request for information
(RFI),^[16] <#cite_note-digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu-16> the procedure
necessary to verify compliance with the DSA, and one is being subjected
to a formal proceedings.^[21] <#cite_note-21> 3 further platforms, all
of them providing adult content, were added on 20 December 2023.^[22]
<#cite_note-22>


Legislative history

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Digital_Services_Act&action=edit&section=4>]

The European Commission <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
European_Commission> submitted the DSA alongside the Digital Markets Act
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act> (DMA) to the
European Parliament <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament>
and the Council <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Council_of_the_European_Union> on 15 December 2020.^[5]
<#cite_note-:3-5> ^[23] <#cite_note-auto1-23> The DSA was prepared by
von der Leyen Commission <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Von_der_Leyen_Commission_I> members Margrethe Vestager <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_Vestager> (Executive Vice President of
the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Executive_Vice_President_of_the_European_Commission_for_A_Europe_Fit_for_the_Digital_Age>) and Thierry Breton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Breton> (European Commissioner for Internal Market <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_Internal_Market>).^[24] <#cite_note-24>

The Digital Services Act builds in large parts on the non-binding
Commission Recommendation 2018/314 of 1 March 2018^[25] <#cite_note-25>
when it comes to illegal content on platforms. However, it goes further
in addressing topics such as disinformation and other risks especially
on very large online platforms. As part of the preparatory phase, the
European Commission launched a public consultation on the package to
gather evidence between July and September 2020.^[26] <#cite_note-26>
^[27] <#cite_note-27> An impact assessment was published alongside the
proposal on 15 December 2020 with the relevant evidence base.^[28]
<#cite_note-28>

The European Parliament appointed Danish Social Democrat Christel
Schaldemose <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christel_Schaldemose> as
rapporteur for the Digital Services Act. On 20 January 2022 the
Parliament voted to introduce amendments in the DSA for tracking-free
advertising and a ban on using a minor's data for targeted ads, as well
as a new right for users to seek compensation for damages.^[29]
<#cite_note-29> In the wake of the Facebook Files revelations <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Facebook_leak> and a hearing by Facebook
Whistleblower Frances Haugen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Frances_Haugen> in the European Parliament,^[30] <#cite_note-30> the
European Parliament also strengthened the rules on fighting
disinformation and harmful content, as well as tougher auditing
requirements.^[31] <#cite_note-31>

The Council of the European Union adopted its position on 25 November
2021.^[32] <#cite_note-32> The most significant changes introduced by
the Member States are to entrust the European Commission with the
enforcement of the new rules, in the wake of allegations and complaints
that the Irish Data Protection Watchdog was not effectively policing the
bloc's data protection rules against platform companies.^[33]
<#cite_note-33>

The Data Governance Act <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Data_Governance_Act> (DGA) was formally approved by the European
Parliament on 6 April 2022.^[34] <#cite_note-EP_20220406-34> This sets
up a legal framework for common data spaces in Europe which will
increase data sharing in sectors such as finance, health, and the
environment.^[34] <#cite_note-EP_20220406-34> ^[35] <#cite_note-
Daly_20220427-35>

With Russia using social media platforms to spread misinformation about
the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine>, European policymakers felt a
greater sense of urgency to move the legislation forward to ensure that
major tech platforms were transparent and properly regulated, according
to /The Washington Post/.^[36] <#cite_note-Zakrzewski_20220422-36> On 22
April 2022, the Council of the European Union and the European
Parliament reached a deal on the Digital Services Act in Brussels
following sixteen hours of negotiations.^[37] <#cite_note-
Satariano_20220422-37> ^[38] <#cite_note-EU_PR_20220423-38> ^[39]
<#cite_note-39> According to /The Washington Post/, the agreement
reached in Brussels solidifies the two-bill plan— the Digital Services
Act and the Digital Markets Act, a law regulating competition. The
latter is aimed at preventing abuse of power against smaller competitors
by larger "gatekeepers".^[36] <#cite_note-Zakrzewski_20220422-36>

On 5 July 2022, the European Parliament approved both the DSA and the
DMA.^[40] <#cite_note-parl072022-40> Following this, on 4 October 2022,
the European Council <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council>
gave its final approval to the DSA.^[41] <#cite_note-41> The DSA was
adopted on 19 October 2022 and was published in the Official Journal of
the European Union <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Official_Journal_of_the_European_Union> on 27 October 2022.^[1]
<#cite_note-:2-1> It came into force <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Entry_into_force> on 16 November 2022.^[42] <#cite_note-42> Most
services were given 15 months to comply with its provisions (until 17
February 2024^[43] <#cite_note-43> ). However, "very large" online
platforms and search engines, after their designation as such, had only

Influence of the European Court of Human Rights

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Digital_Services_Act&action=edit&section=5>]

The DSA was passed alongside the Digital Markets Act <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act> and the Democracy Action
Plan.^[44] <#cite_note-44> The latter of these is focused on addressing
the nuanced legal interpretation of free speech on digital platforms, a
fundamental right that has been extensively guided by the European Court
of Human Rights <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
European_Court_of_Human_Rights> (ECtHR) and the European Convention on
Human Rights <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
European_Convention_on_Human_Rights>.^[45] <#cite_note-45> Accordingly,
the Democracy Action Plan, and subsequently the DSA, were strongly
influenced by the /Delfi AS v. Estonia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Delfi_AS_v._Estonia>/ and /Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and
Index.hu Zrt v. Hungary/ ECtHR cases, which outlined a framework for
assessing intermediary liability on digital platforms.^[46] <#cite_note-46>

In /Delfi AS v. Estonia/, the ECtHR applied proportionality analysis
when considering whether the Estonian courts' decision to hold the
online platform Delfi liable for hate speech posted by its users was a
proportionate restriction on Delfi's right to freedom of
expression.^[47] <#cite_note-:0-47> The court found that, given the
serious nature of the hate speech, the Estonian courts' actions were
justified to protect the rights of others.^[48] <#cite_note-48> In other
words, the ECtHR upheld the liability of online platforms for hate
speech posted by their users, underlining that platforms could be
expected to take proactive steps to control content when there is a
clear risk of harm from unlawful comments. This case highlighted the
responsibilities of platforms to prevent the spread of harmful
content.^[47] <#cite_note-:0-47>

On the other hand, the /MTE and Index.hu v. Hungary/ case illustrated
the nuanced limits of freedom of speech on digital platforms.^[49]
<#cite_note-:1-49> In its application of proportionality analysis, the
ECtHR found that the Hungarian courts had failed to strike a fair
balance between protecting reputation and ensuring freedom of
expression.^[50] <#cite_note-50> The Hungarian courts imposed strict
liability on the platforms for user comments that were offensive but did
not constitute hate speech, constituting a disproportionate interference
in the platforms' right to freedom of expression. The ECtHR ruled that
imposing strict liability on platforms for user comments, without
consideration of the nature of the comments or the context in which they
were made, could infringe on freedom of expression. This judgment
emphasized the need for a balance between protecting reputation and
upholding free speech on digital platforms.^[49] <#cite_note-:1-49>

These decisions by the ECtHR provided critical legal precedents that
shaped the EU's decision-making process on the framework of the DSA. In
particular, the DSA drew from the ECtHR's distinction between different
types of illegal content, as well as its proportionality analysis in
both cases, by incorporating nuanced rules on intermediary liability and
ensuring that measures taken by platforms do not unreasonably restrict
users' freedom of expression and information.^[51] <#cite_note-51>


Reactions

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Digital_Services_Act&action=edit&section=6>]

Media reactions to the Digital Services Act have been mixed. In January
2022, the editorial board of /The Washington Post <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post>/ stated that the U.S. could
learn from these rules,^[52] <#cite_note-52> while whistleblower Frances
Haugen stated that it could set a "gold standard" of regulation
worldwide.^[53] <#cite_note-53> Tech journalist Casey Newton <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Newton> has argued that the DSA will shape
US tech policy.^[54] <#cite_note-54> Mike Masnick of Techdirt <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techdirt> praised the DSA for ensuring the right
to pay for digital services anonymously, but criticised the act for not
including provisions that would have required a court order for the
removal of illegal content.^[55] <#cite_note-55>

Scholars have begun critically examining the Digital Services Act.^[56]
<#cite_note-56> ^[57] <#cite_note-57> Some academics have expressed
concerns that the Digital Services Act might be too rigid and
prescribed,^[58] <#cite_note-58> excessively focused on individual
content decisions or vague risk assessments.^[59] <#cite_note-59>

Civil Society organisations such as Electronic Frontier Foundation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation> have
called for stronger privacy protections.^[60] <#cite_note-60> Human
Rights Watch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch> has
welcomed the transparency and user remedies but called for an end to
abusive surveillance and profiling.^[61] <#cite_note-61> Amnesty
International <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International> has
welcomed many aspects of the proposal in terms of fundamental rights
balance, but also asked for further restrictions on advertising.^[62]
<#cite_note-62> Advocacy organisation Avaaz <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Avaaz> has compared the Digital Services Act to the Paris Agreement
for climate change.^[63] <#cite_note-63>

Following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel>, Thierry Breton <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Breton> wrote public letters to X
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter>, Meta Platforms <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms>, TikTok <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/TikTok>, and YouTube <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube> on how
their platforms complied with the DSA regarding content related to the
conflict and upcoming elections. The Atlantic Council <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Council>'s Digital Forensic Research Lab
reported that Breton's letters did not follow DSA processes, and digital
rights group Access Now <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Now>
criticised Breton's letters for drawing a "false equivalence" between
illegal content and disinformation.^[64] <#cite_note-64>

Tech companies have repeatedly criticised the heavy burden of the rules
and the alleged lack of clarity of the Digital Services Act,^[65]
<#cite_note-65> and have been accused of lobbying to undermine some of
the more far-reaching demands by law-makers, notably on bans for
targeted advertising,^[66] <#cite_note-66> and a high-profile apology
from Sundar Pichai <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai> to
Breton on leaked plans by Google to lobby against the Digital Services
Act.^[67] <#cite_note-67>

A bipartisan group of US senators have called the DSA and DMA
discriminatory, claiming that the legislation would "focus on
regulations on a handful of American companies while failing to regulate
similar companies based in Europe, China, Russia and elsewhere."^[68]
<#cite_note-68> ^[69] <#cite_note-69>

The DSA was mostly welcomed by the European media sector.^[70]
<#cite_note-70> Due to the influence gatekeepers have in selecting and
controlling the visibility of certain journalistic articles over others
through their online platforms, the European Federation of Journalists
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Federation_of_Journalists>
encouraged EU legislators to further increase the transparency of
platforms' recommendation systems via the DSA.^[71] <#cite_note-71>

Nevertheless, the DSA's later stage inter-institutional negotiations, or
trilogues <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_trilogue_meeting>, have
been criticized as lacking transparency and equitable
participation.^[72] <#cite_note-72> These criticisms mirror past
experiences with the drafting of the EU Regulation on Preventing the
Dissemination of Terrorist Content Online as well as the General Data
Protection Regulation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
General_Data_Protection_Regulation> (GDPR).^[73] <#cite_note-73>

Swedish member of the European Parliament Jessica Stegrud <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Stegrud> argued that the DSA's focus on
preventing the spread of disinformation and "harmful content" would
undermine freedom of speech <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Freedom_of_speech>.^[74] <#cite_note-74>

After the first round of the 2024 Romanian presidential election
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Romanian_presidential_election> was
invalidated due to reports allegedly showing Russian involvement on
TikTok in favor of Călin Georgescu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
C%C4%83lin_Georgescu>, an investigation was conducted to determine
whether TikTok had breached the DSA.^[75] <#cite_note-75>


Impacts

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Digital_Services_Act&action=edit&section=7>]


Feature and content removal

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Digital_Services_Act&action=edit&section=8>]

In August 2024, TikTok <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok> agreed to
withdraw its TikTok Lite rewards feature after it was investigated under
the DSA due to concerns about its "addictive effect", especially for
children.^[76] <#cite_note-g958-76> ^[77] <#cite_note-o819-77>

A 2024 study of deleted Facebook and YouTube comments by the Future of
Free Speech think tank at Vanderbilt University <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University> suggested that "platforms,
pages, or channels may be over-removing content to avoid regulatory
penalties" under the DSA.^[78] <#cite_note-x614-78>


Outside the EU

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Digital_Services_Act&action=edit&section=9>]

/The Washington Post <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
The_Washington_Post>/ wrote in 2023 that tech companies may apply
features instituted to comply with the DSA to countries outside of the
EU, and that researchers have argued that the DSA could provide a
framework for the United States to impose stricter regulations on tech
companies.^[79] <#cite_note-g454-79> /The Economist <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist>/ wrote in 2023 that the Brussels
effect <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect>, whereby social
media platforms implement EU regulations globally to save costs, "is far
from guaranteed" with the DSA due to tech companies being unwilling to
"[lose] sovereignty over their digital territories everywhere".^[80]
<#cite_note-h670-80>

Among legal academics, Dawn Nunziato of the George Washington University
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University> argued in
2022 that the DSA "will further instantiate the Brussels Effect, whereby
EU regulators wield powerful influence on how social media platforms
moderate content on the global scale".^[81] <#cite_note-r313-81> Suzanne
Vergnolle of the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatoire_national_des_arts_et_m%C3%A9tiers>
stated her belief in 2023 that the DSA would have a Brussels effect,
similar to that of the General Data Protection Regulation <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation>, but that
"it's going to take years".^[82] <#cite_note-p803-82> Martin Husovec of
the London School of Economics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
London_School_of_Economics> and Jennifer Urban of the University of
California, Berkeley <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
University_of_California,_Berkeley> wrote in 2024 that "the chances of
spontaneous voluntary implementation beyond the EU's borders for four
key parts of the DSA — content moderation procedures, transparency and
governance obligations, and risk management rules — seem modest."^[83]
<#cite_note-d321-83>


Similar legislation

The 2023 Brazilian Fake News Bill <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Brazilian_Congressional_Bill_No._2630>, a proposed new social media
regulation framework introduced in the National Congress <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_National_Congress>, heavily referenced
the DSA and contained similar provisions.^[84] <#cite_note-c058-84>
