    "reasoning": "The risk of mistranslation leading to changes in the meaning of sensitive messages is a significant concern, as it may result in miscommunication or misunderstanding. While there's no explicit regulation regarding AI Auto Chat Translation in India, Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 could potentially apply due to handling personal data. Furthermore, Article 5 of GDPR should be complied with given the feature involves personal data. The jurisdiction being India may limit the applicability of GDPR.",
