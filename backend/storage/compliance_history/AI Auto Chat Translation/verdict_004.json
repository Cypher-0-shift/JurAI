    "reasoning": "The feature is used by users across multiple jurisdictions, and it collects personal data (voice/audio, location, images/media, text/messages) that is stored indefinitely. As such, the compliance requirements for data protection laws like GDPR may differ between EU member states. The reported error in Report 1 suggests that one of the Jury Agents encountered an issue while processing the data, which indicates a need for geo-specific logic.",
