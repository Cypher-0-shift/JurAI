This could potentially change the meaning of sensitive messages, triggering compliance obligations under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 in India (Section 43 and Section 43A). Additionally, the feature stores chat translations for a duration of 6-12 months which may raise further concerns under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (Section 43A).",
